If the hypothesized value of $\\theta$ were feasible, the likelihood under $\\theta_0$ should be close to the max. If the hypothesized value of $\\theta$ were not feasible, $L(\\theta_0\\mid\\textbf{x})$ should be much smaller. To make the comparison, we consider the likelihood ratio test statistic, $\\Lambda$: \n",
